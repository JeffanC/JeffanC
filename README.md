# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeffan Chen!

I graduated with a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Sydney and am currently working at CNNIC. My primary research interests lie in Machine Learning, with a focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). I’m always open to discussions and collaborations—let’s connect and share ideas!

## 🛠️ Projects
### - KA-GAT: A Novel Graph Neural Network
### - VAE4NODE: Dual-task VAE for Node-Level Data Augmentation

## 🎯 Future Goals

### Research Advancements
I aim to continue pushing the boundaries of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with a particular interest in integrating these models with Large Language Models (LLMs) to unlock new capabilities.
### Academic Contributions
I plan to contribute more to the academic community through research that emphasizes the reliability and interpretability of neural networks, with the hope of publishing in top journals and conferences.
